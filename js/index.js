// That's it! Now on to Lab 3...
// Create a JavaScript function that permits the creation of a hamburger object
// Consider that a hamburger has many options â€“ that might include
/*
    different types of buns,
    vegetable garnishes, 
    assortments of cheeses, 
    specialty sauces, 
    different meat patties(beef, chicken, vegetarian), 
    single, double, or triple patty, 
    Pickles, hot peppers, olives etc.
*/
// add some extra if you want
// Make sure that the function allows for the output of a sentence that describes the hamburger, too
